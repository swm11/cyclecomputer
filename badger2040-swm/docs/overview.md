# Badger 2040 & Badger 2040 W: Overview

Badger 2040 and Badger 2040 W are small, low-power, badge-style boards with a 2.9", 296x128 pixel, monochrome e-paper display.

They are best used with MicroPython, and we've created a custom firmware with built-in drivers so you can get the most out of it.

## Badger 2040

Badger 2040 uses an onboard RP2040 chip paired with 2MB flash.

## Badger 2040 W

Badger 2040 W mounts a Pico W in lieu of an RP2040. This includes wireless functionality onboard.

Badger 2040 W also includes a PCF85063A real-time clock, which can wake Badger up from its power-off state.
