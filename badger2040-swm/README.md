## Install

Grab the latest release from [https://github.com/pimoroni/badger2040/releases/latest](https://github.com/pimoroni/badger2040/releases/latest)

There are four .uf2 files to pick from.

:warning: Those marked `with-badger-os` contain a full filesystem image that will overwrite both the firmware *and* filesystem of your Badger:

* pimoroni-badger2040-vX.X.X-micropython-with-badger-os.uf2 
* pimoroni-badger2040w-vX.X.X-micropython-with-badger-os.uf2 

The regular builds just include the firmware, and leave your files alone:

* pimoroni-badger2040-vX.X.X-micropython.uf2 
* pimoroni-badger2040w-vX.X.X-micropython.uf2
